The source application is [ruby complete](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/dfe-complete-conversions-transfers-and-changes).

❌ - not included. This page is routed fully by ruby and does not come through the front door  
⚠️ - feature flagged. Hitting this route in ruby with the session cookie `"dotnet-bypass"` (any value) will redirect through front door to dotnet. Otherwise, the route will be handled by ruby

🆕 - route added. There are new rules in place for this route as of this release
## Operators

Current "operators" in use include:
 - Begins With - any request route that begins with the specified route will be have the front door rule applied. `projects/*` matches: `projects/foo`, `projects/bar`  
 - Equal - the route must be an exact match. `projects/foo/bar` matches only: `projects/foo/bar` 
 - RegEx - the route will have to match a RegEx pattern

**NB**: The table only includes routes that have forwarding enabled for any environment. It is not an exhaustive list of routes that are available on either app.
