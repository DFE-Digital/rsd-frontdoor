## Description
The following rules are applied for the complete application.

The source application is [ruby complete](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/dfe-complete-conversions-transfers-and-changes).

Traffic is redirected to the [dotnet application](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/complete-conversions-transfers-changes) for the routes specified.

> **IMPORTANT**  
> 
> As of release 12 (see [version history](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/rsd-frontdoor/blob/main/docs/complete_fd_rules.md#version-history)), the frontdoor configuration will be reversed on develop - test and prod to follow shortly - meaning that the source application will be dotnet, with the redirect target being ruby.

## Key

✅ - included. Hitting this route in ruby app will redirect through front door to dotnet for this environment  
❌ - not included. This page is routed fully by ruby and does not come through the front door  
⚠️ - feature flagged. Hitting this route in ruby with the session cookie `"dotnet-bypass"` (any value) will redirect through front door to dotnet. Otherwise, the route will be handled by ruby  
❌ → ✅ - represents a rule change in the most recent update  
🆕 - route added. There are new rules in place for this route as of this release
## Operators

Current "operators" in use include:
 - BeginsWith - any request route that begins with the specified route will be have the front door rule applied. `projects/*` matches: `projects/foo`, `projects/bar`  
 - EndWith - any request route that end with the specified route will be have the front door rule applied. `/tasks/handover` matches: `project/123/tasks/handover`    
 - Equal - the route must be an exact match. `projects/foo/bar` matches only: `projects/foo/bar` 
 - RegEx - the route will have to match a RegEx pattern


See a more definitive list of operators [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/rules-match-conditions?tabs=portal&pivots=front-door-standard-premium#operator-list)


**NB**: The table only includes routes that have forwarding enabled for any environment. It is not an exhaustive list of routes that are available on either app.

## Ruby fallback

It is possible to ignore all of the rerouting rules in your local browser, which can be very useful for testing and debugging.

By providing the request cookie `dotnet-disable`, all routes will revert to ruby rather than redirecting to .net.

## Task identifiers

We are releasing various tasks through the front door - a list of tasks which will progressively get longer.

For brevity, I've just referenced these tasks as {task_identifiers} in the Routes table (see below).

The full "route" looks something like this: **/projects/\*/tasks/{task_identifiers}** - where {task_identifiers} matches one of the promoted tasks.

At present, these tasks are:
- handover
- stakeholder_kick_off
- proposed_capacity_of_the_academy
- supplemental_funding_agreement
- articles_of_association
- deed_of_variation
- conditions_met
- redact_and_send
- redact_and_send_documents
- receive_grant_payment_certificate
- declaration_of_expenditure_certificate
- deed_of_novation_and_variation
- confirm_date_academy_opened
- confirm_date_academy_transferred
- church_supplemental_agreement
- commercial_transfer_agreement
- main_contact
- land_questionnaire
- land_registry
- master_funding_agreement
- confirm_incoming_trust_ceo_contact
- risk_protection_arrangement
- rpa_policy
- confirm_headteacher_contact
- check_and_confirm_financial_information
- bank_details_changing
- academy_details
- complete_notification_of_change
- check_accuracy_of_higher_needs
- land_consent_letter
- deed_termination_church_agreement
- deed_of_termination_for_the_master_funding_agreement
- confirm_chair_of_governors_contact
- request_new_urn_and_record
- confirm_outgoing_trust_ceo_contact
- trust_modification_order
- tenancy_at_will
- subleases
- share_information
- closure_or_transfer_declaration
- form_m
- confirm_incoming_trust_has_completed_all_actions
- one_hundred_and_twenty_five_year_lease

> 
> This release marks a significant change in the front door terraform.  
> This is the first release that will see the ruby to complete frontdoor reversed.  
> Instead of traffic being sent from ruby to .net, this will now be the other way round.  
> The reversal is release on dev environment only at the moment  
- add a new variable `enable_custom_reroute_reversal` in \[env\].tfvars to toggle front door reversal for this environment. **N.B** - this is a "transition" variable. Once dev/test/prod are all reversed, we will no longer need it  
- move forwarding ruleset from ruby to .net container when the `enable_custom_reroute_reversal` flag is true  
- ensure that `dotnet-bypass` and `dotnet-disable` conditions still work with the reversal  
- update routing rules to be the inverse of what they were - drop any routes that are live on dev, add any routes that are not  
- release 3 new tasks on dev environment  
- switch beta.dev.* and dev.* domains - not source tracked, dev.tfvars only

**11 - 2025-10-21**
- add 2 more task routes using the EndsWith pattern
- release external contacts to test and prod. RegEx: `/projects/{project_id}external-contacts/*`
- service support users to dev, feature flagged in test/prod using a BeginsWith pattern. Route: `/service-support/users/*`

**10 - 2025-10-06**
- add notes to test and prod environments using a regex match. RegEx: `^projects/[^/]+/(?:(?:notes)(?:/.*)?)$`
- add 11 more task routes using the EndsWith pattern
- release task list to test and prod. RegEx: `^projects/[^/]+/tasks$`
- external contacts to dev, feature flagged in test/prod using a regex match. RegEx: `/projects/{project_id}external-contacts/*`
- /form-a-multi-academy-trust to all environments using a BeginsWith pattern
- add dao-revocation & complete to all environments using a regex match. RegEx: `/projects/{project_id}dao-revocation/*` and `/projects/{project_id}complete/*`

**9 - 2025-10-02**
- remove notes feature flag from test and prod to allow for "clean" testing. Notes will need releasing after all tasks due to TmpData buglets  
- add various tasks routes (10 in total) using an EndsWith pattern  
- add date history and about the project (/information) using the same regex as project notes, internal contacts
- add `/projects/{project_type}/{project_id}*` to all environments using a regex match. RegEx: `^projects/(?:conversions|transfers)/[^/]+(?:/.*)?(?:#.*)?$`

**8 - 2025-08-28**
- add notes, internal contacts and task list to dev, feature flagged in test/prod
- add `/projects/{project_id}/internal-contacts/*` to all environments using a regex match. GET and POST requests expected for creating urns. RegEx: `^projects/.*/internal-contacts.*`
- add `/projects/{project_id}/tasks` to all environments using a regex match. RegEx: `^projects/[^/]+/tasks$`
- add `/projects/{project_id}/notes` to all environments using a regex match. RegEx: `^projects/[^/]+/notes.*` - **Note** This needs testing thoroughly with task notes because there's metadata that impacts flow
- add `/search/user` to all environments using a regex match. RegEx: `^search/user(?:\\?(?:[^\\/#]*))?$`

**7 - 2925-08-22** - Promote team projects, your projects and project handover to production  
**6 - 2025-08-20**
- add privacy notice, groups, service support (LAs and URNs) in production
- add `/projects/{project_id}/academy-urn` to all environments using a regex match. GET and POST requests expected for creating urns. RegEx: `^projects/[^/]+/academy-urn$`
- for tighter checks, we could consider RegEx: `^\/projects\/([0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12})\/academy-urn$`

**5 - 2025-08-15** - add privacy notice and groups routes, and add feature flag to service support (LAs and URNs) in production  
**4 - 2025-08-07** - add access-denied route, which exists only on .NET. Otherwise, access denied pages present as "Page not found"  
**3 - 2025-08-05**
- release additional listing pages to production, excluding "Your projects" and "Team projects"
- release handover to dev and to test/prod with feature flag  

**2 - 2025-07-25** - change export and reports to exact match as "All projects by month" has a CSV download that uses `/projects/all/exports/*`  
**1 - 2025-07-25** - initial documentation. Capture FD rules as they are
